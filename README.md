# Introduction

You can host your personal websites on GitHub Pages.  It requires you have a GitHub account and set up a repository for your website.  

Given the different ways that people view websites, from computers with large screens to phones with small screens, we have increasingly started to rely on professionally developed website responsive website templates as a starting point, because it takes care of making sure your website looks good on any browser or device.

In this activity, we will use [HTML5 Up!](https://html5up.net/) for our site templates.

When you are doing web development, you can start out with all the files on your computer and view them locally through your web browser.  When you are happy with the results, you can upload it to a webserver.  

In this case, GitHub Pages will be your web server.

# Getting started with HTML5 Up!

1. Navigate to [HTML5 Up!](https://html5up.net/)
2. Find a theme you like.
3. Walk through the live demo to see how it works.
4. Download the zip file to your computer
5. Move the zip file to your working directory.  When you unzip it, all the files will be in your working directory.
6. Your "home" page is ```index.html```.  This is a text file that contains HTML markup code, as well as references to CSS and Javascript code that may be in other files.  
7. Open ```index.html``` in your web browser.  You can either use the Open File menu for your browser, or you can drag the ```index.html``` file to your web browser. 
9. Use a text editor to modify index.html.  Make a small change and save the file.  Refresh your web browser to see the change to your "home" page.
10. Keep working with this until you get the page to your liking.

# Getting started with GitHub Pages

If you have ```git``` installed on your computer, you can follow this tutorial: [Setting Up a Personal Website](https://medium.com/coderbyte/setting-up-a-personal-website-with-github-pages-2f64be0189f0)

However, if you don't have ```git``` installed on your computer, you can actually just do everything through a web browser, including editing the files in your git repository.   See this [tutorial](https://roelofjanelsinga.com/articles/how-to-set-up-automatically-deploy-website-github-pages/) .
1. Login to your GitHub account.  If you don't have one, you can sign up for one.
2. Make a new repository
3. Select the main branch, and create a new branch called gh-pages.
4. Add your files by selecting the ```Add File``` button next to the green ```Code``` button.   You can drag all of your files to the landing spot on the web browser.   Please add a commit message that describes the change you just made and click ont he green ```Commit Changes``` button at the bottom of the screen.   It will take a little time for the files to be processed.
5. You will access your new website at a special URL or web address.  Access your new website at this URL: https://<github username>.github.io/<repo name>
6.  You can edit any text files by navigating to the file, and clicking on the pencil icon in the upper right.  Any time you edit the file, you need to specify a commit message and then click on the green ```Commit Changes``` button.
  
Please note that GitHub can take a couple of minutes to update your site after you make a change.   

As an example: this repository([https://github.com/ldang/gwc_html5](https://github.com/ldang/gwc_html5)) contains a website that can be accessed at [https://ldang.github.io/gwc_html5](https://ldang.github.io/gwc_html5)
